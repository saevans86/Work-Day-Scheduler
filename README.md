# Work-Day-Scheduler
base code https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme


I was provided with a base code for a work day scheduler, the purpose of this assignment was to have 
the time slots colors on the calendar change based on whether it was the past, present, or future. 


My goal for this assignment was to use as much jquery as possible. 
I didn't really see the functionality of jquery at first since it seems like it's being used less and less, but having the knowledge of it seems pretty vital in the event I encounter older codes that primarily use jquery. This project probably tught me the most by finding different ways to implement functions, variables, loops and how selectors function within JS/HTML/CSS which required more understanding of "vanilla" javascript, and things that weren't necessarily solidified as knowledge previously.
